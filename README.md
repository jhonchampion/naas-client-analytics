# NAAS(NGO-as-a-service) Client Intake Analytics

Project Overview

Servelead Humanitarian Initiative needed to scale its NAAS (Nonprofit-as-a-Service) offering by automating client intake, analysis, and recommendation delivery.

Manual review of NGO responses was:
	•	Time-intensive
	•	Subjective
	•	Difficult to scale

I designed and deployed a fully automated assessment and reporting pipeline using Google Sheets and Apps Script.
